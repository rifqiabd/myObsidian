Do you think it's okay to make an exception to your clients or do you have to stick to the rules?

## My Opinion
In my opinion, it would be better if we stick to the rules. However, if we are rigid and do not provide solutions to problems that arise in the future, then our business will not develop. The most important thing is not to violate existing laws in business regulations. As well as maintaining relationships between employees and superiors.

In this case, I think the customer service is good. because it doesn't break the rules. and make customers satisfied, and vice versa. Customer service wants to listen to customer complaints, wants to read the rules and regulations that exist in the business. So our business produces a win-win solution for other businesses.
