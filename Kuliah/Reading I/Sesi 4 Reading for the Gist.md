## Topic-Nouns

> [!quote] McWhorter:
> *a group of related ideas. The sentences relate to one another in the sense that each is about a common person, place, thing, or idea. This common subject or idea is called the topic. Simply defined, the topic is what the entire paragraph is about* (1992:168)
> 
> Sekumpulan ide yang terkait.  Kalimat yang terkait kepada satu sama lain bahwa masing masing kalimat berkaitan dengan orang, tempat, benda, atau ide. Subyek atau gagasan umum ini di sebut sebagai Topik. Secara sederhana, topik adalah isi dari keseluruhan paragraf

Flemming explains topic more clearly: "Sometimes the topic of a paragraph can be expressed in one word, but often you need two or more words to express the topic properly." (1987: 114) In different terms Tyner explains the topic. Tyner says that:

> [!quote] Tyner:
> A paragraph is a group of sentences that develops one main point or idea. One important feature of an effective paragraph is unity: all sentences within the paragraph are related to the main point.Â (1987: 2)


## Supporting Noun
Supporting nouns atau supporting details adalah kata benda yang mendukung topic. Supporting nouns berupa penjelasan, ilustrasi, atau contoh dari topic tersebut. Kata benda ini bisa berupa frasa tetapi kadang-kadang juga berupa kalimat

# Diskusi
>[!assignment]
Identify the topic sentence of the following paragraph and list the supporting details!

We had a terrible storm last night. The winds blew up to fifty miles an hour, and it rained very hard. Eucalyptus tress by the river blew over, and one tree hit a power line and clacked out the area for five hours. Downtown, the main street was flooded, and cars were left stranded in bumper-deep water. Before morning, the river flooded its banks, and people living nearby were forced to flee their homes with whatever belongings they could gather. It was the worst storm in the country since 1958.
