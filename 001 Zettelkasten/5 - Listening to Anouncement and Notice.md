Assalamu'alaikum. Wr. Wb.

Hello everyone, I'd like to share my thoughts on the topic discussed above.
# Do you have any difficulties in understanding the announcements?
I had no significant difficulty understanding the announcement. Because, the pronunciation in the announcement is very clear, and everything is very good to listen to. Hearing it makes you feel like imitating it.

However, the lack of vocabulary made me have to look for the meaning of the announcement.

Like the "Platform" example, I think it's an application or media. After I searched it turned out that "Platform" was Platform on train or _"the raised flat area next to the track at a train station where you get on or off the train"_[^1]

Then, I had difficulty understanding the British accent. because here I often use an American accent rather than a British accent

# Which transportation do I prefer to use? Plane or Train?
I don't know what it's like to ride a plane or a train, because I've never been on either. However, if asked to choose between the two. There are two points I want to discuss:
Firstly, using the train is a more economical choice when compared to taking a flight, and it's quite convenient to find a train station in almost every Indonesian city, particularly in Java. Nonetheless, it's important to note that train travel is generally slower than air travel.

Second, the cost of using air travel is higher than that of using the train, and not all Indonesian cities are equipped with airports. As a result, individuals desiring to fly have to make their way to cities that have airport facilities. On the flip side, air travel is notably faster than train travel.
