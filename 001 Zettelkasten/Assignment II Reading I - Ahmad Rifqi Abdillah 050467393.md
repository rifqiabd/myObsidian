1. a. **The text is**
	- [ ] Argumentative
	- [ ] Informative
	- [x] Narrative
	b. **The text mainly about :**
	- [ ] the solutions to deforestation 
	- [ ] the causes and effects of deforestation 
	- [x] the effects and solutions of deforestation 
2. Correct the following false statements with precise details
	a. **Deforestation takes please in the developed countries (paragraph 1)**
		Deforestation primarily occurs in developing countries, not developed ones. For instance, South America experiences significant deforestation due to the demand for agricultural land.
	b. **Deforestation happens only at the national national level (paragraph 2)**
		Deforestation occurs at both local and national levels. Locally, individuals may clear land for farming due to economic challenges and population growth. Nationally, governments may grant logging concessions to address debts and industrial development
	c. **The cutting and burning of trees effect mainly the Main (paragraph 3)**
		The cutting and burning of trees have substantial effects, not only on the main, but also on the environment. Trees store carbon, and when burned, carbon is released into the atmosphere. Deforestation contributes to reduced rainfall, increased temperatures, and adverse impacts on various ecosystems, affecting both flora and fauna.
	d. **Deforestation is not as dangerous as many people think (paragraph 4)**
		Deforestation poses serious dangers, contrary to the notion that it is not as dangerous. The removal of trees leads to environmental imbalances, such as increased carbon in the atmosphere, disruption of rainfall patterns, and loss of biodiversity. Addressing the root causes is crucial to mitigating these dangers.
3. **Focus on pharagraph (3) and complete the table**

| Event                | Result |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| The cutting of trees |  Reduction in the number of trees and deforestation, leading to habitat loss for numerous species.      |
| The burning of trees |  Release of carbon into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change; reduced rainfall, elevated temperatures, and environmental impact on various ecosystems.      |

4. Answer the following questions.
	a. **Why are some governments for deforestation? (pharagraph 2)**
		Some governments support deforestation as a way to generate revenue, cover debts, and foster industrial development. Selling logging concessions is one way they attempt to address economic challenges.
	b. **Whose responsibility is to resolve the problem (pharagraph 4)**
		Resolving the problem of deforestation is a collective responsibility that involves governments, environmental organizations, activists, and the global community. While organizations like Greenpeace make efforts to save the rainforests, addressing the root causes requires coordinated action at local, national, and international levels.
5. **According to you how can we stop deforestation?**
	To stop deforestation, a diverse approach is needed: sustainable forestry practices, the establishment and enforcement of protected areas, promotion of eco-friendly agricultural methods, international cooperation, involvement of local communities, strict regulations and law enforcement, consumer awareness raising, investment in alternative materials and technologies, support for reforestation programs, and advocacy for policies prioritizing environmental conservation.
