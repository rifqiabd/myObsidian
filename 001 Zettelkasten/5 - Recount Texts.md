# Menggunakan Obsidian Sebagai Catatan
Last month, I frequently used traditional paper notebooks to take notes, but I struggled with organizing them effectively. So, I decided to look for a better solution and came across "Obsidian."

On my first day using Obsidian, I was impressed by its user-friendly features, like "Community Plugin," "Canvas," and "Graph View." I decided to commit to using it for a full month.

On the second day, I encountered some issues, such as problems with syncing my notes in the cloud and integrating them across devices. Thankfully, I found support in the Obsidian community, particularly in the "r/ObsidianMD" subreddit on Reddit and the Obsidian enthusiasts' Telegram group in Indonesia.

As the month passed, I not only got used to Obsidian's features but also saw significant improvements in how I organized my notes, especially when using the dynamic Graph View. Using Obsidian became enjoyable, and I hoped that more of my friends would start using it too.
