# 5 - Listening to Weather Forecast
## Discussion
Do you like to listen to a weather forecast before you go somewhere? Why?
___
I don't like listen to a weather forecast before i go somewhere, instead listen it i prefer to read a weather forecast report. Because, listening it taking too long time. I like to read that because we can at least avoid any undesirable possibilities, although we still cannot avoid disaster. So, there is no harm in reading the weather forecast.

Thank you and stay healty

It's great Suci, but I can't imagine how complicated it would be if we prepared both directly

Tidak apa apa mempercayai ramalan cuaca, yang terpenting kita tidak musyrik dengan mempercayai Mbak Rara
It's okay to trust the weather forecast, the most important thing is that we don't commit by trusting Mbak Rara
