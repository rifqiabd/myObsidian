Find out the pattern of the following paragraph then identify the connectors refers to the pattern!

Human activities from pollution to overpopulating are driving up the earth’s temperature and fundamentally changing the world around us. The main cause is a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect.  Gases in the atmosphere, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons let the sun’s light in, but keep some of the heat from escaping like the glass walls of a greenhouse.  The more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the more heat gets trapped, strengthening the greenhouse effect and increasing the earth’s temperature.  Human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, have increased the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by more than a third since the Industrial Revolution.  The rapid increase in the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has warmed the planet at an alarming rate.  While Earth’s climate has fluctuated in the past, atmospheric carbon dioxide hasn’t reached today’s levels in hundreds of thousands of years.  Climate change has consequences for our oceans, our weather, our food sources and our health (source: National Geographic)

The paragraph's structure revolves around showcasing a cause-and-effect correlation concerning climate change resulting from human activities and the greenhouse effect. This is the connector in the paragraph:

1. "The main cause is a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect" - introducing the primary cause .  
2. "The more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the more heat gets trapped" - indicating a proportional relationship between the concentration of greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect's intensity.
3. "Human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels" - specifying actions contributing to greenhouse gas increase.  
4. "While Earth's climate has fluctuated in the past" - presenting a contrast with historical carbon dioxide levels.  
5. "Climate change has consequences for our oceans, our weather, our food sources, and our health" - summarizing the impacts by highlighting the broader consequences of climate change.

Deforestation 
1) Deforestation simply put means the removal of trees and forests, usually through cutting or burning. In South America, most deforestation takes place because of a need for agricultural land. In countries with poor economies, such as those in South America , people turn to agriculture to meet the everyday needs of living. 
2) The causes of deforestation are mainly related to a Competitive global economy, which forces poorer countries to use their only resources For money. This happens both locally and nationally. Locally, people use land for farming to mane money, due to poverty and increasing populations. Nationally, governments sell logging concessions to cover debts and develop industries. 
3) The problem is, using their forests is only a short-term solution, which is causing even worse, and long-term effects. Trees are made of about 5096 carbon, so when trees are burnt, carbon is released into the atmosphere. Cutting them down reduces the amount of rain, raising temperatures and allowing the sun to heat up the land and dry it out. Also greatly affected are the animals and plants that live in the rainforests. Tropical rainforests hold about 5096 of earth's species of animal. When we destroy their habitat, we Kill them too. 
4) The solutions to Problems such as deforestation lie in addressing the root cause. Organizations such as Greenpeace and other activists mane a huge effort to save the rainforests, but in doing so they mane many enemies. And, if deforestation continues at its current rate, in just 100 Years there will be no more rainforests left.

<<<<<<< HEAD
	**a. *Deforestation takes please in the developed countries (paragraph 1)***
		Deforestation mainly occurs in developing countries, not in developed countries. For example, South America is experiencing significant deforestation due to the need for agricultural land.
	**b. *Deforestation happens only at the national national level (paragraph 2)***
		Deforestation occurs both at the local and national levels. Locally, individuals may clear land for agriculture due to economic challenges and population growth. Nationally, the government can provide logging concessions to overcome debt and industrial development
	**c. *The cutting and burning of trees effect mainly the Main (paragraph 3)***
		The cutting and burning of trees have substantial effects, not only on the main, but also on the environment. Trees store carbon, and when burned, carbon is released into the atmosphere. Deforestation contributes to reduced rainfall, increased temperatures, and adverse impacts on various ecosystems, affecting both flora and fauna.
	**d. *Deforestation is not as dangerous as many people think (paragraph 4)***
		Deforestation poses serious dangers, contrary to the notion that it is not as dangerous. The removal of trees leads to environmental imbalances, such as increased carbon in the atmosphere, disruption of rainfall patterns, and loss of biodiversity. Addressing the root causes is crucial to mitigating these dangers.
3. *Focus on pharagraph (3) and complete the table*
=======
	a. **Deforestation takes please in the developed countries (paragraph 1)**
		Deforestation primarily occurs in developing countries, not developed ones. For instance, South America experiences significant deforestation due to the demand for agricultural land.
	b. **Deforestation happens only at the national national level (paragraph 2)**
		Deforestation occurs at both local and national levels. Locally, individuals may clear land for farming due to economic challenges and population growth. Nationally, governments may grant logging concessions to address debts and industrial development
	c. **The cutting and burning of trees effect mainly the Main (paragraph 3)**
		The cutting and burning of trees have substantial effects, not only on the main, but also on the environment. Trees store carbon, and when burned, carbon is released into the atmosphere.

| Event                | Result |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| The cutting of trees |  Reduction in the number of trees and deforestation, leading to habitat loss for numerous species.      |
| The burning of trees |  Release of carbon into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change; reduced rainfall, elevated temperatures, and environmental impact on various ecosystems.      |

4. Answer the following questions.
<<<<<<< HEAD
	a. *Why are some governments for deforestation? (pharagraph 2)*
		Some governments support deforestation as a way to generate revenue, cover debts, and foster industrial development. Selling logging concessions is one way they attempt to address economic challenges.
	b. *Whose responsibility is to resolve the problem (pharagraph 4)*
		Resolving the problem of deforestation is a collective responsibility that involves governments, environmental organizations, activists, and the global community. While organizations like Greenpeace make efforts to save the rainforests, addressing the root causes requires coordinated action at local, national, and international levels.
5. *According to you how can we stop deforestation?*
	To stop deforestation, a diverse approach is needed: sustainable forestry practices, the establishment and enforcement of protected areas, promotion of eco-friendly agricultural methods, international cooperation, involvement of local communities, strict regulations and law enforcement, consumer awareness raising, investment in alternative materials and technologies, support for reforestation programs, and advocacy for policies prioritizing environmental conservation.
