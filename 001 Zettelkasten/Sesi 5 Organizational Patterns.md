Find out the pattern of the following paragraph then identify the connectors refers to the pattern!

Human activities from pollution to overpopulating are driving up the earth’s temperature and fundamentally changing the world around us. The main cause is a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect.  Gases in the atmosphere, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons let the sun’s light in, but keep some of the heat from escaping like the glass walls of a greenhouse.  The more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the more heat gets trapped, strengthening the greenhouse effect and increasing the earth’s temperature.  Human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, have increased the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by more than a third since the Industrial Revolution.  The rapid increase in the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has warmed the planet at an alarming rate.  While Earth’s climate has fluctuated in the past, atmospheric carbon dioxide hasn’t reached today’s levels in hundreds of thousands of years.  Climate change has consequences for our oceans, our weather, our food sources and our health (source: National Geographic)
